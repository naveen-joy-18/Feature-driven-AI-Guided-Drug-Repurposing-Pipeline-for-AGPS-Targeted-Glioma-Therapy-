# Feature-driven-AI-Guided-Drug-Repurposing-Pipeline-for-AGPS-Targeted-Glioma-Therapy-
We present an AI-driven pipeline for repurposable cancer drug discovery. Applied to glioma, we identified AGPS as a target, screened 576k compounds, and found F2881-0267 with strong stability and drug-like features. The framework generalizes across cancers.
